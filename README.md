# vite-react-formik
An experiment for testing vite with React, Formik and TypeScript

## Why
[vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) is a "web dev build tool" that serves your ES Module imports during dev and bundles for prod.
My motivation behind using this is to compare it to the current webpack based tooling available. 

## Getting started

* Install dependencies
```shell script
yarn install
```
* Run dev mode
```shell script
yarn dev
```
* Build for production
```shell script
yarn build
```

* Typecheck
```shell script
yarn typecheck
```
